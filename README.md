This is my first(naive) attempt at image classification with deep learning.I used deep learning to detect whether a given brain scan has a tumor or not. The Library of choice is TensorFlow
The model is a binary classifier that is trained on a dataset of brainscans. Simply put, we feed in an image of a patient's brain scan, and it detects whether that patient has a brain tumor or not. The dataset was found on kaggle, however, it has relatively few samples(150), the best models are trained on thousands to tens of thousands of samples. Still it's a start and a new learning benchmark.
